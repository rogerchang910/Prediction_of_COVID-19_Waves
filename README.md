# Prediction of COVID-19 Waves
## Abstract
The goal is to predict the trend of COVID-19 cases in different regions based on variables such as previous case numbers, confirmed individuals in different age groups, and the ICU beds used for COVID-19. By checking the data in the beginning, we impute the missingness and conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the relationship of variables. We built two models and compared the results made by them to see whether they supported each other. The result indicates that COVID-19 might not be as periodic as we thought and the trend is more arbitrary due to the emergence of new variants. Therefore, we may need more information and records about this pandemic to construct an effective model.

## Data
The main data sources were the [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/g62h-syeh) Hospital Capacity and Patient Impact Timeseries data as well as consolidated data sets utilized by [Johns Hopkins University CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) for their COVID tracking dashboard.
